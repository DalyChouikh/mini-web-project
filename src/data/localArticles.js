    summary:
      "A clear, simple desk can help you focus longer and feel less stressed.",
    content:
      "A minimalist study desk is not about having nothing on it. It is about keeping only what actually supports your work. Start by removing every item you do not use daily. Then put back your laptop, a notebook, a pen, and one small personal object you like. Keep cables hidden as much as possible, and avoid stacking books you are not actively reading. The goal is that when you sit down, you know exactly what you are here to do. Over time, you can refine your setup, but the first big win is simply having fewer distractions in front of you.",

    title: "How to Take Smart Digital Notes",
    summary:
      "Stop rewriting your lectures and start building a useful knowledge base.",
    content:
      "Digital notes work best when they are short, connected, and easy to search. Instead of typing everything your teacher says, capture only key ideas, definitions, and examples. After class, spend ten minutes cleaning your notes: add headings, fix spelling, and create simple links or tags. Over time this turns into a personal knowledge base you can reuse for projects and exams. The important part is not the tool but the habit. Choose one app you like, keep the structure consistent, and review a few old notes each week.",
